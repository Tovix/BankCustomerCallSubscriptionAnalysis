## Overview

This project leverages the Bank Marketing Dataset to build a comprehensive A/B testing optimization platform for digital marketing campaigns. Using advanced statistical methods, Monte Carlo simulations, and machine learning techniques, we analyze customer behavior patterns and optimize marketing strategies for maximum conversion rates.

**Key Objectives:**
- Identify optimal customer targeting strategies
- Develop statistical frameworks for A/B testing
- Build predictive models for campaign success
- Create interactive dashboards for campaign analysis
